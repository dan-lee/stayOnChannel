YouTubeâ„¢ Stay On Channel
=============

Do you want the old YouTube channel behaviour back? Here's the solution.

When clicking on a video on any featured channel, you will now stay on this channel.
No more redirecting to videos and playlists which annoys and costs time.

After clicking a video link the video will be loaded into the "featured video" player at the top and you can watch it there without the need of refresing the page.

Until now this only works on the "featured channel", but will be extended for every feed.
There will be more settings for the little details to make it more accessible.

I am also planning support for playlists, minimizing video link lists, etc. etc.
