YouTubeâ„¢ Stay On Channel
=============

Do you want the old YouTube channel behaviour back? Here's the solution.

When clicking a video link on any channel, you will no more be redirected.
Instead you will stay exactly there!

After clicking a video link the video will be loaded into the "featured video" player at the top and you can watch it there without the need of refresing the page.

This works for any kind of channel ("Featured" or "Feed" channel).
And what if there's no player to be played with? Easy: This extension will create one on the top!

Until now this only works on the "featured channel", but will be extended for every feed.
There will be more settings for the little details to make it more accessible.


*I am also planning support for playlists, minimizing video link lists, etc. etc.*
