YouTubeâ„¢ Stay On Channel
=============

Do you want the old YouTube channel behaviour back?
Here's the solution.

By clicking on a video on any channel you will stay there without being redirected to the video page!

After you clicked on the video link, the video will be loaded into the "featured video player" at the top, or if there's no player available, you're asked if one should be created automatically

This works for any kind of channel ("Featured" or "Feed").

**New in v1.3**:
 - Auto play mode: When a video is finished the next will be played automatically.
Also the button "load more" is triggered when a playlist has come to an end and it will play all the way through :)

We are also planning support for playlists, minimizing video link lists, etc., etc.
